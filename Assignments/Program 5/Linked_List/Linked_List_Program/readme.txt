Description:
     This program plays a simple game using linked lists. The program has all the required function, but many go unused since they aren't required for the program functionality. I have tested all functionality and the program works just fine without any memory leaks!

Notes:
     I have tested the push_back() and push_front() functions and both of them work. So, please feel free to comment one push function and uncomment the other in the main file to test both. I have also done both extra credit works. I have implemented merge sort for both ascending and descending orders and selection sort (extra credit) for descending order. So, please feel free to comment one type of sort and uncomment the other in the Linked_List class to test both sorts. I have also done the other extra credit where I implemented my whole program using template classes. Since I had to work with templates, I have no cpp files, so I put function prototypes and definitions in two header files (one for Node and the other for Linked_List). I also have a Makefile for that. Hence, I have two tar files for this assignment - one which has my original program without template classes (works for signed integers but cannot take large integers), and the other program which has template classes (works for both signed and unsigned integers). As a side note, if you want to large numbers such as 4294963943, please do so only after compiling and executing the template class program because the other program (i.e., one that does not have template classes) is not designed to take large integers and will return negative numbers. When running the template class program, please enter such large numbers only in the unsigned version (note: there will be prompt at the very beginning asking you whether you want unsigned or signed integers - signed is the usual version where you are allowed to enter positive and negative, but small, integers; you can enter small and long integers in the unsigned verion, however, you cannot enter negative numbers in the unsigned version). If you happen to enter such a large number when running the template class program, please wait for some time in the end because it may take time to check for and print prime numbers for such as large number after sorting. The template class program with long unsigned integer(s) can also take even more time when running with valgrind. So, please do not immediately break out of the program if you realize the program is taking a some time to output primes. Have fun playing around!
